# DictionaryApp

First project made with Angular. The idea was to redo this app, which i had already done in React and JS Vanilla to understand Angular and see the diference between both frameworks.
The app uses the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/), and the Angular HttpClientModule to made the request to the API. The Styles were made with Bootstrap.

## App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
